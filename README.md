2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Ensure the `img/` folder is in the same directory so images load correctly.

## 📌 Notes

- This is a **static front-end demo** — no backend or JavaScript functionality is included.
- The design is desktop-first. Basic responsiveness is partially included in `styles.css` using media queries.
- Image paths assume an `img/` folder with subfolders (`icons/`, `products/`, `u/`).
